### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy. I work as a passionate design engineer on Windsurf and Codeium!

Previously, I built a website builder for an acquired YC startup as the only engineer/designer, was a PM for Uber, designed for Quora, was an early engineer at Figma and studied software engineering at University of Waterloo.

In my free time, you can find me [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35585776), [writing](https://andyzhang.substack.com/) and [tweeting](https://x.com/andyzg3)
