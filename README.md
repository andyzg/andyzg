### Hi there 👋

I'm Andy. I work as a passionate design engineer on Windsurf and Codeium!

Previously, I built a website builder for an acquired YC startup as the only engineer/designer, was a PM for Uber, designed for Quora and was an early engineer at Figma. I'm also a proud University of Waterloo alumni.
